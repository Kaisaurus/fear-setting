What if I ...

Doing something new or making a change in your live can be scary.

Anxiety clouds our minds, making it hard to see which way to go and sometimes even freeze us into inaction.

This is an exercise to define what lingers in your mind and to help you take a deliberate decision.

It will walk you through several questions, give you an overview and offers you to send these to your future self.

“Named must your fear be before banish it you can.”
